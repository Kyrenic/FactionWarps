# FactionWarps

## Prerequisites
Make sure to download and install [Medieval Factions 5](https://github.com/Dans-Plugins/Medieval-Factions/releases) first, or else this plugin will not work since it is an extension of that.
 
## Description
This plugin aims to extend the functionality of [Medieval Factions 5](https://github.com/Kyrenic/Medieval-Factions) in the form of player defined warps. These warps are integrated with the faction system, aiming to feature options to ban certain players or factions, to open or close your warps to other players or factions and to tax each use of the warp. If you would like a feature added, you can do so by making a feature [here](https://github.com/Kyrenic/FactionWarps/issues) and then give it the label "request". If you want to report a bug, that can also be done [there](https://github.com/Kyrenic/FactionWarps/issues), but instead give it the label bug.

It is completely integrated into the factions permission system, featuring permissions for creating, deleting, editing and listing warps, in addition to permissions for warping to your own warps and warping to other faction's warps.

The plugin also features a wide variety of options including:
- Maximum warps per faction
- Teleport delay
- Teleport cooldown
- Teleport sound
- Teleport countdown sound
- Translation files (Thanks to the [MF5](https://github.com/Kyrenic/Medieval-Factions) team for letting me use their system!)
- More that you can suggest [here](https://github.com/Kyrenic/FactionWarps/issues)!

Not all of the above features are finished yet, and especially the taxation will take some brainwaves to implement as I'm not familiar with Vault or the MF5 expansion called Currencies. But, I am certain that this will eventually be added.

## Installation
Installation is a relatively simple process. Simply follow the following steps:
